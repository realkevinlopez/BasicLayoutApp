I have finally finished the BasicLayoutApp. There is a bug I cannot solve. When you scroll and click on a cell, my navigation does not correctly pass the image and data from the cell to the detail view. If you continually click in and out of the same cell, it takes about 4 iterations to display the correct image, then it will not mess up anymore. So, the data is being passed, but something went wrong in my implementation. I will stop trying to solve this issue for now and continue catching up with the rest of my assignments this weekend.
